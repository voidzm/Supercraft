Supercraft is an in-development mod for Minecraft. You can get some more information about it on the [wiki](https://www.github.com/voidzm/Supercraft/wiki).

Build scripts are provided in the repository for both Mac and Windows. You **need** a valid modding installation of Minecraft Forge to make the build scripts work. You should have the repository folder named "supercraft" placed alongside the "forge" folder. The build scripts will take care of assembling the sources and the resources into one place and producing the artifact. You need to zip everything in the "forge\mcp\reobf\minecraft" folder together (NOT the folder itself), and then you can install it in a Forge-modded version of Minecraft.

I am not providing support for this mod until it is released. Things are highly experimential, subject to change, and at times very buggy.
